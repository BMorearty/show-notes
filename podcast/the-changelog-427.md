Regarding the name "Rocky Linux" - The new project's name is a tribute to CentOS co-founder Rocky McGaugh. "He is no longer with us, so as a H/T to him, who never got to see the success that CentOS came to be, I introduce to you... Rocky Linux," [said Kurtzer](https://twitter.com/jaypatelbsd/status/1336586567171727361).
