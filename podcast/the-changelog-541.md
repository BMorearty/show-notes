The common denominator for these conversations is open source AI.

Beyang Liu and his team at Sourcegraph are focused on enabling more developers to understand code and their approach to a completely open source, model agnostic, coding assistant called Cody has significant interest from us.

Denny Lee and the team at Databricks recently released Dolly 2.0, the first open source, instruction-following LLM, that has been fine-tuned on a human-generated instruction dataset and is licensed for research and commercial use. They want to be the platform of choice the future of AI development.

Stella Biderman gave the keynote address on generative AI at the conference and works at the base layer doing open source research, model training, and AI ethics. Stella trained the EleutherAI pythia model family that Databricks' used to create Dolly - 2.0.
