- From [this post](https://www.vice.com/en/article/kzp7ny/tractor-hacking-right-to-repair) on Vice/Motherboard â€” Kyle Schwarting is a farmer by trade, and a hacker by necessity. His farm, about 20 minutes outside the city limits of Lincoln, Nebraska, is full of tractors and agricultural equipment, which he picks up in various states of repair from fellow farmers, fixes up, and resells. "I would say what I'm doing is hacking," Schwarting tells me, gesturing to a Windows laptop and a USB-to-tractor cable he Frankensteined himself.
