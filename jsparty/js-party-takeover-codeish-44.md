GraphQL is a querying language with the aim of increasing the productivity of frontend and backend developers. It can make working with React easier, be used as an API for third-party clients, and allow for feature-rich applications to request precisely the data they need. Like any part of your stack, GraphQL isn't a panacea. The language is still being developed, and has some limitations.
