We're working with Command Line Heroes to promote Season 6. Command Line Heroes is a podcast that tells the epic true tales of developers, programmers, hackers, geeks, and open source rebels who are revolutionizing the technology landscape. It's an awesome show and weâ€™re huge fans of Saron and the team behind the podcast, so we wanted to share it with you.
