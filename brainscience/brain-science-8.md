Goal setting — are you ready for the new year/new you?

​​The Marshmallow Test (Carol Dweck, Ph.D.) — The role of delayed gratification in growth mindset and why self-control is the engine of success.

### ​​3 types of goals

- **Outcome** - Outcome goals are very often binary and involve winning, for example, wanting to win a gold medal or wanting to be the largest company in your sector. Whilst outcome goals are hugely motivating, they are not under your control as they are affected by how others perform and/or other external forces. 
- **Performance** - A performance goal is a performance standard that you are trying to achieve. These are the performance standards you set for yourself to achieve if you are going to build towards your outcome goal. Over time, performance goals build upon one another to help you achieve your outcome goal.
- **Process** - Process goals support performance goals by giving you something to focus on as you work towards your performance goals. Process goals are completely under your control. They are the small things you should focus on or do to eventually achieve your performance goals.

**​​The Kaizen Way** - "itty bitty" steps to move you in the direction of the goal you want to achieve.

### "SMART" Goals

1. Specific
​2. Measurable
​3. Achievable
​4. Realistic
​5. Time Bound

​How committed am I? ​​If I’m optimizing in one way, it will invariably affect other aspects of my life. Therefore, have I considered the implications of this goal in my life?

​​The Role of Identity in the goal setting process. Are my goals aligned with my identity?

### Accountability and Goal Setting

The American Society of Training and Development (ASTD) study on accountability found that you have a 65% of completing a goal if you commit to someone. And if you have a specific accountability appointment with a person you’ve committed, you will increase your chance of success by up to 95%.

### The WILL and the WAY

​​There’s a lot of research around this at the Social and Affective lab at the University of Oregon. Will and Way  ---- "The will refers to the motivational and affective processes that drive goal pursuit such as approach motives, and the way refers to the suite of cognitive capacities and abilities that enable goal pursuit such as inhibitory control.  Neither part is sufficient on its own; both are necessary for effective self-regulation." (https://sanlab.uoregon.edu/research/)

Inhibitory control is a major part of goal achievement. I have to be able to “inhibit” my desire/drive for another behavior and replace it with the more adaptive or desirable one.
