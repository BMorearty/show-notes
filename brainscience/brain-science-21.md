Stories are designed to take you on a journey; a journey you're more likely to remember and relate with as you are apt to examine ways in which you can see yourself in the story. While our biases can interfere with our understanding of others, stories have the power to circumvent the challenges these pose and allows the opportunity for changes in our attitudes and henceforth our responses. When we're able to see ourselves in others' stories, we make others more relatable, and therefore easier to live with and work alongside.
