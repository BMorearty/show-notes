The panel dig deep on code generation in Go. Touching on the new [go:embed](https://golang.org/pkg/embed/) feature in Go 1.16.

They also discuss [IDLs (interface description language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) and [DSLs (domain specific languages)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) and the part they play in code generation.

Brian talks about how we're all guilty of overusing language features, like channels (see [Go channels are bad and you should feel bad](https://www.jtolio.com/2016/03/go-channels-are-bad-and-you-should-feel-bad/) for an example).

The panel refers to https://litestream.io/ at one point, as an example of a closed-open-source project, and you can read more about on the [Litestream GitHub page](https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream#open-source-not-open-contribution).
