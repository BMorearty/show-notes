#### Segment 1: APIs that were not developed

- [[Proposal] Focus Traversal API](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-focus-traversal-api/3427)
- Input elements are still terrible; CSS appearance property
- [Container queries](https://css-tricks.com/lets-not-forget-about-container-queries/)
- Dates still suck, but [they are being fixed](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal)
- [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/)
- Web Components ([RIP?](https://dmitriid.com/blog/2017/03/the-broken-promise-of-web-components/))
- BUT Shadow DOM
- Consistency of CSS Properties BUT [Houdini](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Houdini)
- Button cursor — why do still have to do `button { cursor: pointer; }` ???
- SVG amazing but still 2nd class citizen
- Accessibility should be down in the browser

#### Segment 2: Hypothesizing

- Why didn’t these APIs get anywhere?
- What would've needed to happen for them to have progressed?
- Browser wars; the move towards chromium

#### Segment 3: Shout-outs!!
