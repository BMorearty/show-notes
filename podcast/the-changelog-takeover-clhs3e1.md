A benevolent dictator for life steps down and changes the course of the Python language forever. Guido van Rossum's "Transfer of Power" memo brings attention to the way programming languages evolve.

In this episode, Emily Morehouse makes the connection between Python's technical extensibility and its inclusive community. Michael Kennedy explains how Python is both easy to learn and powerful enough to build YouTube and Instagram. And Diane Mueller highlights how the Python community took the lead on so many inclusive practices that are spreading in techâ€”including the rise of community-led decision-making.

Sometimes, a benevolent dictator can get a language started. But Python shows it's communities that make languages thrive.
